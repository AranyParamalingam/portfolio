For every website I make, I always start creating the pages and adding the images. Following our program's practices I start creating my website in mobile format. First I create the navigation with the footer. Second, I add the content to all my pages while styling it in the css file. Then I work on the media queries and then I go through the assignment requirements. Some of the challanges I faced in this assignment was incoperating bootstrap into the website and styling according to my wireframes. I feel like changing certain elements of a bootstrap item is very difficult. Also, I find difficulty in making my images optimized. Through this assignment, I believe I know how to create a website with bootstrap. Since, I didnt know how to use it properly before and I am saving time by using it.
